# Current Ventures

As of May 2023, I have completed 6/8 semesters at Yale-NUS College and I will be graduating in May 2024. **I am currently an intern at Adatos.AI, where I use Python, R and QGIS to solve meaningful problems across disciplines.** [This is my resume](https://nicholas-ko-zy.github.io/resume/).

I have also been learning more and more about Linux everyday.
