# Current Ventures

As of December 2022, I have completed 5/8 semesters at Yale-NUS College. I am **open to work between May 2023 and July 2023.** [This is my resume](https://nicholas-ko-zy.github.io/resume/).

I  am currently reading _"The Idea of A University: A Re-examination", Jaroslav Pelikan, Yale University Press_.

I am also learning to use Linux.
