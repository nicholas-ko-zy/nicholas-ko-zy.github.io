# About Nicholas Ko

I am a data science major at [Yale-NUS College](https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/about/key-facts/), a liberal arts college set up by Yale University and the National University of Singapore. I am skilled in Python, R and passionate about using data to solve meaningful problems across disciplines. 

I often get questions about what data science _is_, which is a fair question because it does sound like another buzzword. As Neil Postman wrote in _"Teaching as a Subversive Activity"_, (I paraphrase) knowing what something's called isn't the same as knowing what it is or how it works. In my search for a concise way to explain myself at parties, I have found [Drew Conway's venn diagram](http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram) useful.

I am currently a summer intern with Adatos.AI, where I use Python, R and QGIS to solve meaningful problems in agriculture.
