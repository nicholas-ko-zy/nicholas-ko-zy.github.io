# About Nicholas Ko

I majored in mathematical, computational and statistical sciences at [Yale-NUS College](https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/about/key-facts/). I am currently employed in Singapore. Previously, I <u>interned at Adatos.AI</u>, where I worked on satellite image analysis. I am also a former <u> research assistant at Yale-NUS College</u> under Associate Professor Michiel van Breugel. I am grateful to all who taught me in each of these places.

Right now, I'm interested in operations research (OR) because I think there's rigourous math and useful modelling techniques there. Another reason that drew me to OR is because the field has managed to stay out of the limelight of popular media for now. I am a bit of a contrarian.

On the personal front, I have been a jazz enthusiast ever since I heard Bill Evan's "Portrait in Jazz" album in 2014. My favourite album is "Stan Getz & Bill Evans", favourite track of the album is "Grandfather's Waltz".

A bit on my academic background below.
