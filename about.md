# About Nicholas Ko

I am a data sscience major at [Yale-NUS College](https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/about/key-facts/), a liberal arts college set up by Yale University and the National University of Singapore. I am currently in my third year and **open to work at a full-time internship position** from May 2023 to July 2023 (3 months).

I have used R and Python in most of my projects. I recently explored visualisations of geospatial information using QGIS. 

_I thought I would be a philosophy major, after that, an urban studies major but finally settled on data science._
