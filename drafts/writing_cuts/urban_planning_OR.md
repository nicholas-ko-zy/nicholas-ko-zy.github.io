I often wondered if I can find new ways to think about how things come together in this world. As a student I took for granted that things just existed. I recently joined the "working world" and I see that things were put in placed for a reason and there's always undercurrent of change ongoing, just at different rates. I think in Singapore there's a large sense of apathy, "What's the point of trying, nothing's going to change". But if there's anything Yale-NUS has taught me, it's there's always room to dream, dream of a better future with better ideas. I think part of reading about the past is to not repeat the mistakes, but one must be careful not to practice what CS Lewis, the Christian author, calls "chronological snobbery". In my own words, "chronological snobby" is thinking that old ideas are less enlightened just because they existed before present time. I think there is no chronological snobbery in mathematics. Once a theorem is proven, you don't have to prove it again in the future and you can the result as many times as you want.

I am drawn by the idea of discovering new perspectives that sound like, "Hey, have you ever thought about xyz issue? Why is that? How come Singapore does that, not like abc country?" I find myself excited by the possibility of gaining novel insights from reading and writing about new ways to think about how to live in cities.

I think operations research is quite low key compared to machine learning. So I was super surprised to find objective functions and constraint equations in my urban studies class. 

Paul Graham, the computer scientist and essayist, once said in his essay [Writing and Speaking](https://paulgraham.com/speak.html?viewfullsite=1), 

> "Having good ideas is most of writing well. If you know what you're talking about, you can say it in the plainest words and you'll be perceived as having a good style."

So I hope that by writing about planning, math and Singapore, I can form good ideas to scratch my curiosity itch.

Here's what I want to understand

* the ecosystem of computational planning tools that people have used throughout history
* the assumptions and goals of the various city models
* the limitations of various city models
* the implications on our living and happinesss as a result of these models

What I am not trying to do (or cannot do):

* write essays to make URA to notice that I have better ideas than them
* post fancy visualisations and colourful plots to make you think I am good with data

What is operations research? Well, if you wanted to, you could have already googled the definition and come up with the answer yourself. <b> *ahem\* </b> But I give an answer here to save you some clicks. In my own words, Operations Research is the field of study that seeks to model and optimise a real-world phenmenon using mathematics. What does it mean to model something? I would define a model as an approximate representation of a more complicated object in the real world. 

In physics, we have the model of the basic particles which make up everything in our world. The model of the atom. We look at a table and wonder what properties the atoms in a table must have in order to keep the table from melting, or vapourising into thin air. So some smart people came up with the theory that atoms can be modelled as something with protons and neutrons in the middle and surrounded by electrons.
