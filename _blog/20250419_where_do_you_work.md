This is an accurate portrayal of what happens when people ask me what I'm doing for work now. If you're reading this and we've met in person, we've probably had a similar conversation.

### INT. AT A SOCIAL EVENT

<body> TIGHT on Nicholas, who is at this moment, undercaffinated and waiting for the inevitable question about where he works. He furrows his eyebrows and breathes deeply.

His conversation partner opens his/her mouth, Nicholas's pupils dilate. </body> 

**Person**
<center> So, uh, where do you work now? </center>


**Nicholas**
<center> I work at DSO.</center>

**Person**
<center> Huh DXO? You army ah? </center>

**Nicholas**
<center> DSO National Labs. DSO stands for Defence Science Organisation, it's an R&D lab for the military.</center>

**Person**
<center> Oh you work at DSTA! Your office, is it near Redhill there? </center>

**Nicholas**
<center> Umm, no. DSO is separate from DSTA. Our office is near Kent Ridge MRT. </center>

**Person**
<center> Orhhh, ok ya ya. </center>
