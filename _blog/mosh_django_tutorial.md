# Learning about Django from Mosh

 This post documents what I've learnt from a Django tutorial on Youtube. There are many video tutorials promising to teach you Django in the least painful way. I landed on [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHux0gMZ3Eg). Althought it wasn't painful, it's [incomplete](#conclusion). I'm learning Django so I can eventually build a GIS web app. Some ideas I've had for my web app are:

* A map that displays the schedule of what's on at my favourite music venues and cinemas. I don't like visiting 5 different websites to plan my weekend. Why not have one site that puts it all in one place? (Not that my weekends are *that* free now that I'm writing this blog...) ðŸ™„

* A map to visualise solving the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem using real-world locations but without real-time traffic data. I'm thinking of getting the vertices and edges from OpenStreetMap.



Here's a summary of what I learnt from Mosh's tutorial:

## Starting a Django project

Assuming you've activated a virtual environment with Django installed, these are the steps to create a Django project from scratch. 

Let's suppose your project name is "storefront", because you're building an e-commerce site. [^1] Run this in your terminal to set up your project folder directory:

```
django-admin startproject storefront .
```
*You can replace `storefront` with any project name.*

Remember not to leave out the period, `.`, otherwise Django will create **another** parent folder like this:

```
.
â””â”€â”€ storefront
    â””â”€â”€ storefront
```
*Then you now have a redundant parent folder named `storefront`.*


Inside the `storefront` folder, you'll get this default directory structure.

```
.
â””â”€â”€ storefront
    â”œâ”€â”€ __init.py
    â”œâ”€â”€ asgi.py
    â”œâ”€â”€ settings.py
    â”œâ”€â”€ urls.py
    â””â”€â”€ wsgi.py
```

* `__init__.py`: Turns the directory into a package, so you can import it from elsewhere.

* `settings.py`: A config file for the entire website. Here's where you specify things like where you database is.

* `urls.py`: Defines what urls get used for what in your website.

* `asgi.py`/`wsgi.py`: For web deployment. Too complicated for me to understand now.

* Other files that are created:

    * `manage.py`: A wrapper for `django-admin`. It is used to manage your project with admin privileges. Here's an example using both `manage.py` and `django-admin` to deploy the website locally, with slight differences.
  
      ```
      django-admin runserver
      ```
        *^Doesn't look through your `settings.py`* 
      
      vs
        ```
        python manage.py runserver
        ```

        *^Looks through your `settings.py`* 


If you run `python manage.py runserver` in your terminal, you'll go to your development site.

## Apps

> *"Each Django app is just a collection of apps, each providing several functionalities."*
> 
> -- <cite>Mosh (paraphrase mine)</cite>


Django breaks down a large web app into subapps using object oriented programming. Going back to what I learnt about SOLID principles, I can apply the 'S' for 'Single-reponsibility principle' here. Say we still want to create an E-Commerce web app. Then, I should have an app to handle the various tasks you'd expect when shopping online, such as:

* **Customers:** Handles customers data.
  
* **Products:** Handles product data.

* **Cart:** Handles products that the customer selected.

Etc.

To view your apps, go into your settings module and look for `INSTALLED_APPS`. 

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
]
```

What you see on top are the default apps that appear when you create a Django project from scratch.

### Creating an app called `playground`
Following the tutorial, I created a custom app (called "playground"). To do so, you need to run the following command in a new terminal. Before that, you should already have another terminal with the website running in the background (use: `python manage.py runserver`).

```
python manage.py startapp playground
```

The command above creates a new folder with another standard folder structure. This folder will have the same name as our app, "playground". After creating an app, you need to add your app to `INSTALLED_APPS` in your `settings.py` file.

*Before*
```python
# settings.py
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
]
```

*After*
```python
# settings.py
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    # Our newly added app
    'playground' # <-
]
```

We'll come back to the `playground` app after we define a Python function to return a response to the client.

## Views

> *"A view function, or view for short, is a Python function that takes a web request and returns a web response."*
> 
> -- <cite>Django Documentation</cite>


More accurately, a view function is a [Request Handler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request%E2%80%93response). For example, I want to sort the display of products on my E-Commerce site from highest to lowest price. The user's click event is the web request, given as input to the Python function. The function then returns the sorted products as the response. Mosh gives a much easier example. He writes a view function that returns "Hello World" immediately upon arriving at some URL.

Here's the "Hello World" function:

```python
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.http import HttpResponse
# Create your views here.

def say_hello(request):
    """
    This is a view function that can do anything you want
    it to do as long as it's properly defined. For example,
    you can write a function to
    * Pull data from a database
    * Show an image
    * Send email response
    For now we will get it to just say "Hello".
    """
    return HttpResponse('Hello World')
    
```


To map your view function to a URL, we add a file called `url.py` in the playground folder. (Remark: You can call this file anything, but we name it `url.py` by convention)

After writing your URL map in our custom app `playground`, we want to add that to the overall URL config in `storefront`. Inside
`storefront/urls.py`, there's actually instructions to help with this task.
```python
"""
--cut--
Including another URLconf
    1. Import the include() function: from django.urls import include, path
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  path('blog/', include('blog.urls'))
--cut--
"""
```

Step 1: Have this in your custom app's `urls.py` file.

```python
# storefront/urls.py
urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('playground/', include('playground.urls'))

```

Step 2: Have this in your overrall project's `url.py` file.
```python
# playground/urls.py
urlpatterns = [
    # NOTE: Always end route with a forward slash.
    path(route='hello/', view=views.say_hello)
]
```

Now, when you go to the URL, /playground/hello, you'll get the "Hello World" response.

## Templates

We managed to return "Hello World" in plain text, but what if we want to add some HTML to this site? Templates are used to return HTML content to the client. 

Step 1: Create a new folder called `templates` in your playground folder. 

Step 2: Create a template file, name it whatever you want. In Mosh's example, he names it `hello.html`. 

Step 3: Now that we have a template, we want to display our response (the output of the view function) to the client in a custom HTML template. For example, we want the view function to return 'Hello World' using within `<h1>` tags. And we don't want to hard code this inside our view function, but instead customise it in our template `hello.html`, which again, resides in our `templates` folder. 

We have to make some tweaks to the view function, since we no longer want to print plain text but render it through the HTML template of our choice. Before we had the view function return a HTTP response `HttpResponse('Hello World')` but now we want to return a **render** of the HTML template. 

*Before*
```python
def say_hello(request):
    return HttpResponse('Hello World')
```

*After*
```python
def say_hello(request):
    return render(request=request, template_name='hello.html')
```

`hello.html`:
```html
<h1>Hello World</h1>
```
*Below: Screenshot of the rendered "Hello World" page using `hello.html`. Inspector shows the HTML underneath.*
![Hello World rendered through the hello.html template](/img/mosh_django/hello_world_h1_template.png)

Now we can change the HTML file to also output variables, not just hard-coded plain text. To do so:

Step 1: Pass in an argument to the `context` parameter of your view function `say_hello`.

```python
def say_hello(request):
    return render(request=request, template_name='hello.html',
                  context={'name':'Nicholas'})
```

Step 2: Edit your HTML file to include the variable name, which is the key value of the dictionary. In our case, `'name'`. The HTML will render the value, `'Nicholas'`.

```html
<h1>Hello {{ name }}</h1>
```

## Debugging a Django app in VSCode

Step 1: In your IDE, click the 'Run & Debug' button, create a `launch.json` file.

Add breakpoint, run debugger. Invoke breakpoint by going to playground/hello url.

You can click 'Step Over' (shortcut F10) which will run the breakpoint line and go to the next one. You'll have a local variable `x` now. 'Step Over' runs the code line-by-line.

![](/img/mosh_django/step_over_gives_local_var_x_1.png)

You also have 'Step Into', which allows you to inspect what is going on within a function, in case there are any bugs. The difference being that 'Step Over' will evaluate the functio and return the output but 'Step Into' will go inside the function.

![](/img/mosh_django/step_into.gif)

You can also 'Step Out' which returns you back to the function call line you were previously at. 

Remember to remove your breakpoints after you are done debugging.

Tip: You can use CTRL + F5 to run the project instead of running the `python manage.py runserver` command in your terminal.

## Django Debug Toolbar

Step 1: After you've pip-installed `django-debug-toolbar`, add it to your installed apps.

Step 2: Add a new urlpattern inside the main URLconf module.

Step 3: Add middleware

Step 4: Add IP address to your `settings.py` file. It is not created by default, just copy and paste this anywhere in the file.

```python
INTERNAL_IPS = [
    # ...
    "127.0.0.1",
    # ...
]
```
